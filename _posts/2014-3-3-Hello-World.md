so, japanese has more than one word for the concept of "circular".

丸い　「まるい」 and 円い　「まるい」. same pronunciation. the eagle-eyed among you have spotted that one variant oddly has 円 in there. well, a little critical thinking reveals that this variant of the word probably refers to circular as a flat coin, much like a 円.

そうですね。

丸い is more like spherical, but can also refer to planaer objects as well. according to my trusty advisor, 丸い　is more often used in writing than 円い.

more interesting circular facts...

**丸いねこ**: fluffy or fat cat. very useful.

**丸いおしり**: round ass. also very useful.

面白いね？

明日は、これをしようとします。　がんばります。
